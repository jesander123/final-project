    "# Network Model 2\n",
    "This visualization is meant to mimic a human neural network. This model consists of three layers: input layer, association layer, and output layer. The input layer intakes the raw feature data such as loudness, pitch, timbre from the audio. The association layer are the intermediate chromesthesia associations between input features and visual features - mostly working to combine multiple audio features to then activate a visual image associated with those features. Output layer nodes are the visual layer in which activation determines what shapes, color , intnesity the user sees. As the visual output begins, all nodes in adjacent layers are automatically connected to each other (input nodes all connected to association, association nodes all connected to output) with randomized weights set, but as the audio plays the weights have the opportunity to be strengthened based on the learning mechanisms in play. When the audio plays, the input nodes are set, they are turned on in proportion to its strength in the audio. They now contain a signal which is then transmitted to following layers through the edges, similating how action potentials are propagated through neurons carrying a signal. If both the start and end node are activated at the same time, the edge weight increases (Hebbian learning- \"nodes that fire together, wire together), hence why edges grow thicker\n",
